Theo Katzman is best known for his role as multi-instrumentalist and frontman of indie funk jam quartet Vulfpeck. His solo outlet retains the technical proficiency and performance prowess of Vulfpeck but channels the more flamboyant, romantic side of upbeat 80's pop. Katzman's sophomore release "Heartbreak Hits" is a collection of lovesick tunes replete with his soothing, mellow vocal delivery and signature free-wheeling guitar work.

Recorded on March 12, 2018 in Chicago, IL.
