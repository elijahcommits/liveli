Bahamas is the solo project of Toronto-based guitarist Afie Jurvanen who has shared the stage with both Wilco and Feist. Jurvanen's stripped-down and contemplative sound focuses mainly on his voice and guitar - including quiet, indie folk meditations. Bahamas latest record, Barchords, was released through Brushfire Records -- a labeled started by Jack Johnson.

In this session Afie and his group of talented singers (Carleigh Aikins and Felicity Williams) and lone maracas player (Jason Tait) demonstrate why they were named by SPIN and The New York Times one of the highlights of SXSW 2012.

Produced by Ben Lavender, Rachel Puckett and Ross Hinkle for Liveset.
Audio recorded and mixed by Fifth Street Studios.
Shot by Hunter Holder.
Edited and graded by Ross Hinkle.

Special thanks to Bahamas and their team.
